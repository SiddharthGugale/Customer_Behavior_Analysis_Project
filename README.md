🔄 Project Workflow

📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:

✅ Data Preparation,Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.

✅ Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.

✅ Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

✅ Report and Presentation: Write a clear project report summarizing your key findings and business recommendations. Prepare a presentation that visually communicates insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

📊 Data Analysis & EDA

Using Python, the following analyses were performed:

* Handling missing values
* Removing duplicates
* Data type correction
* Outlier detection
* Statistical summaries
* Customer and product trend analysis

Visualizations were used to understand:

* Spending behavior
* Popular product categories
* Seasonal trends
* Customer segments

SQL Analysis

The cleaned data was imported into:

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* SQL Server

SQL queries were used to analyze:

* Top-selling products
* High-value customers
